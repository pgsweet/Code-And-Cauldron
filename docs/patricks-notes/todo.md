# Patrick's TODO:
- [x] create list of commands
- [ ] error checking
    - [x] invalid arguments
    - [x] invalid command
    - [x] invalid syntax
    - [ ] display error in text editor?
        - might have to use the non-legacy editor
- [ ] running the code
    - [ ] make it run slower so the user can process whats happening
        - maybe make it get faster over time so long programs dont take forever
    - [ ] add two different speeds
        - slow and fast
            - could also be a slider?
